THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people youyouyd expect to be involved
in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didndndt
hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which
made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although
he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin
and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which
came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over
garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small
son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a
secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
MCHAPTER ONE
? 2 ?
They didn-1t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the
Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley-1s sister, but they hadn-t met
for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn-t have a
sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as
unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to
think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the
street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but
they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn-1t want Dudley mixing with
a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday
our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to
suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening
all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his
most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily
as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the
window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked
Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but
missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing
his cereal at the walls. . .Little tyke,-1 chortled Mr. Dursley as he left
the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four-s
drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
something peculiar -1 a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr.
Dursley didn-t realize what he had seen - then he jerked his head
around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner THE BOY WHO LIVED
? 3 ?
of Privet Drive, but there wasn-t a map in sight. What could he
have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr.
Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in
his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive - no,
looking at the sign; cats couldn-t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley
gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he
drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of
drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by
something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he
couldndt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn-t bear
people who dressed in funny clothes - the getups you saw on
young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He
drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a
huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a
couple of them weren-t young at all; why, that man had to be older
than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of
him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some
silly stunt t these people were obviously collecting for something
. . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few
minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot,
his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office
on the ninth floor. If he hadndt, he might have found it harder to
concentrate on drills that morning. He didndt see the owls swoop- CHAPTER ONE
? 4 ?
ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did;
they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.
Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He
yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone
calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood
until lunchtime, when he thought he-1d stretch his legs and walk
across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He-1d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a
group of them next to the bakeres. He eyed them angrily as he
passed. He didn-t know why, but they made him uneasy. This
bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn-1t see a single
collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large
doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were
saying.
.
.The Potters, that-1s right, that-1s what I heard --1


-1 yes, their son, Harry -1-
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at
the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but
thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone,
and had almost finished dialing his home number when he
changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his
mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn-t such
an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn-1t even
sure his nephew was called Harry. He-1d never even seen the boy. It THE BOY WHO LIVED
? 5 ?
might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying
Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her
sister. He didn-1t blame her -1 if he-1d had a sister like that . . . but all
the same, those people in cloaks . . .
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon
and when he left the building at five oooclock, he was still so worried
that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.

Sorry,- he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost
fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man
was wearing a violet cloak. He didn-t seem at all upset at being almost
knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a
wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare,
,
,Don-1t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice,
for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!-1
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and
walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a
complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle,
whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off
for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never
hoped before, because he didndt approve of imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he
saw -1 and it didn-t improve his mood -1 was the tabby cat he-d
spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He
was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its
eyes.
-1Shoo!- said Mr. Dursley loudly. CHAPTER ONE
? 6 ?
The cat didn-t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal
cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together,
he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to
mention anything to his wife.
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner
all about Mrs. Next Door-1s problems with her daughter and how
Dudley had learned a new word (((Won-t!-). Mr. Dursley tried to
act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the
living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:
And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the
nation-1s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although
owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight,
there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every
direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls
have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.-1 The newscaster allowed
himself a grin. .Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls
tonight, Jim?-1
-1Well, Ted,-1 said the weatherman, , ,I don-t know about that, but
it-1s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as
far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to
tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, theyeyeve had a
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating
Bonfire Night early -1 it-s not until next week, folks! But I can
promise a wet night tonight.-1
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over
Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all
over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . THE BOY WHO LIVED
? 7 ?
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of
tea. It was no good. He-d have to say something to her. He cleared
his throat nervously. -Er - Petunia, dear - you haven-t heard from
your sister lately, have you?-
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After
all, they normally pretended she didn-t have a sister.

No,- she said sharply. -1Why?-

Funny stuff on the news,- Mr. Dursley mumbled. -Owls . . .
shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in
town today . . .-1
-So?- snapped Mrs. Dursley.
.Well, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do
with . . . you know . . . her crowd.-1
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he-1d heard the name e ePotter.-
He decided he didn-t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could,
,Their son - he-d be about Dudley-1s age now, wouldn-t he?-
-1I suppose so,- said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
What-1s his name again? Howard, isn-t it?-
-Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.-1
-Oh, yes,- said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ly. lYes, I
quite agree.-
He didn-t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs
to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley
crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.
The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as
though it were waiting for something.
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do CHAPTER ONE
? 8 ?
with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to
a pair of -1 well, he didndt think he could bear it.
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but
Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last,
comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters
were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and
Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia
thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn-t see how he
and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going
on -1 he yawned and turned over -1 it couldndt affect them. . . .
How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but
the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was
sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner
of Privet Drive. It didn-t so much as quiver when a car door
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.
In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared
so suddenly and silently youyd have thought he-d just
popped out of the ground. The cat-1s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He
was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and
beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was
wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and
high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and
sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long
and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This
man-1s name was Albus Dumbledore. THE BOY WHO LIVED
? 9 ?
Albus Dumbledore didn-t seem to realize that he had just arrived
in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.
He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something.
But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he
looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from
the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat
seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, -1I should have
known.-
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It
seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up
in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a
little pop. He clicked it again - the next lamp flickered into darkness.
Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights
left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance,
which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out
of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn-1t
be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set
off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the
wall next to the cat. He didn-t look at it, but after a moment he
spoke to it.

Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.-
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was
smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square
glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its
eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair
was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.
How did you know it was me?- she asked.
.My dear Professor, I-1ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.-1 CHAPTER ONE
? 10 ?
-1You-1d be stiff if you-d been sitting on a brick wall all day,- said
Professor McGonagall.
All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have
passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.-
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

Oh yes, everyone-1s celebrating, all right,-1 she said impatiently.
-1You-1d think they-1d be a bit more careful, but no -1 even the Muggles
have noticed something-1s going on. It was on their news.- She
jerked her head back at the Dursleys-1 dark living-room window. .I
heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they, they,re not
completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting
stars down in Kent t I-ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He
never had much sense.-1
-You can-t blame them,-1 said Dumbledore gently. -We-1ve had
precious little to celebrate for eleven years.-
-1I know that,- said Professor McGonagall irritably. -But that-1s
no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless,
out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle
clothes, swapping rumors.-
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn-t, so
she went on. -A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who
seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found
out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?-
-It certainly seems so,-1 said Dumbledore. .We have much to be
thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?-
-A what?-
-A lemon drop. They-1re a kind of Muggle sweet I-m rather
fond of.- THE BOY WHO LIVED
? 11 ?
No, thank you,- said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though
she didn-t think this was the moment for lemon drops. -As I say,
even if You-Know-Who has gone --1
-My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call
him by his name? All this -You-Know-Whoo nonsense - for eleven
years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his
proper name: Voldemort.- Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore,
who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
.It all gets so confusing if we keep saying -1You-Know-Who.- I
have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort-s
name.-
-I know you haven-t,- said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. -But youyre different. Everyone knows
youyre the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened
of.-
-You flatter me,-1 said Dumbledore calmly. lVoldemort had
powers I will never have.-
-Only because youyre too -1 well -1 noble to use them.-
-It-s lucky it-s dark. I haven-t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.-1
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and
said, -The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying
around. You know what everyone-1s saying? About why he-s disappeared?
About what finally stopped him?-1
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she
was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting
on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had
she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It
was plain that whatever -everyone- was saying, she was not going CHAPTER ONE
? 12 ?
to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore,
however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
.What theyere saying,-1 she pressed on, n, nis that last night Voldemort
turned up in Godric-1s Hollow. He went to find the Potters.
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -1 are -1 that
they-1re - dead.-
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
Lily and James . . . I can-1t believe it . . . I didn-t want to believe
it . . . Oh, Albus . . .-1
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. .I
know . . . I know . . .- he said heavily.
Professor McGonagall-1s voice trembled as she went on. -1That-1s
not all. They-re saying he tried to kill the Potters-1 son, Harry.
But -1 he couldn-t. He couldn-1t kill that little boy. No one knows
why, or how, but they-1re saying that when he couldn-t kill Harry
Potter, Voldemort-1s power somehow broke -1 and that-1s why he-1s
gone.-
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
-It-1s -1 it-1s true?-1 faltered Professor McGonagall. .After all he-s
done . . . all the people he-s killed . . . he couldndt kill a little boy?
It-s just astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in
the name of heaven did Harry survive?-
-We can only guess,-1 said Dumbledore. -We may never know.-
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and
dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great
sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It
was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead,
little planets were moving around the edge. It must have THE BOY WHO LIVED
? 13 ?
made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his
pocket and said, id, iHagrid-1s late. I suppose it was he who told you I-1d
be here, by the way?-
-Yes,- said Professor McGonagall. -And I don-t suppose youyre
going to tell me why youyre here, of all places?-
-I-1ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They-1re the
only family he has left now.-1
-You don-t mean -1 you can-t mean the people who live here?-1
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at
number four. .Dumbledore e you can-t. I-1ve been watching them
all day. You couldn-1t find two people who are less like us. And
they-1ve got this son -1 I saw him kicking his mother all the way up
the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!-1
-It-s the best place for him,- said Dumbledore firmly. lHis aunt
and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he-s older.
I-ve written them a letter.-1
-A letter?- repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back
down on the wall. .Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain
all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He He ll be
famous - a legend -1 I wouldndt be surprised if today was known
as Harry Potter Day in the future - there will be books written
about Harry - every child in our world will know his name!-
Exactly,-1 said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top
of his half-moon glasses. .It would be enough to turn any boy-s
head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something
he won-t even remember! Can-t you see how much better off he-ll
be, growing up away from all that until he-s ready to take it?-1
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, CHAPTER ONE
? 14 ?
swallowed, and then said, ,Yes - yes, you-1re right, of course. But
how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?- She eyed his cloak suddenly
as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath
it.
.Hagrid-s bringing him.-1
-You think it -1 wise -1 to trust Hagrid with something as important
as this?-
-I would trust Hagrid with my life,- said Dumbledore.
I-m not saying his heart isn-1t in the right place,-1 said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, ,but you can-1t pretend he-s not careless.
He does tend to -1 what was that?-
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It
grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for
some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up
at the sky - and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed
on the road in front of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting
astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least
five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so
wild -1 long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his
face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their
leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he
was holding a bundle of blankets.
-Hagrid,- said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. -At last. And
where did you get that motorcycle?-
Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,- said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. .Young Sirius Black
lent it to me. I-ve got him, sir.- THE BOY WHO LIVED
? 15 ?
?
?No problems, were there?-
-No, sir - house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all
right before the Muggles started swarmin-1 around. He fell asleep as
we was flyin- over Bristol.-
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the
bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.
Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously
shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
Is that where - ?-1 whispered Professor McGonagall.
.Yes,-1 said Dumbledore. -1He-ll have that scar forever.-
-Couldn-t you do something about it, Dumbledore?-
-Even if I could, I wouldn-t. Scars can come in handy. I have one
myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground.
Well -1 give him here, Hagrid - we-1d better get this
over with.-
De. - took Harry in his arms and turned toward the
Dursleys- house.
ldn-t d I -1 could I say good-bye to him, sir?-1 asked Hagrid. He
bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must
have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid
let out a howl like a wounded dog.
.Shhh!- hissed Professor McGonagall, -youyll wake the Muggles!-

S-s-sorry,- sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief
and burying his face in it. it. iBut I c-c-can-t stand it -1 Lily an-1
James dead - an- poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles --1
-Yes, yes, it-s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or

gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden
wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the
doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry-1s
blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute
the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid-1s
shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the
twinkling light that usually shone fromore?re-1s eyes seemed
to have gone out.

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung
himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life;th.h a
roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
I shall see you soon, I expectnight,ssor Messor Mcll,-1 said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose
in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the
corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it
once, and twelve balls of light spe and wa to their street lamps so
that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number
four.
.Good luck, Harry,- he murmured. He turned on his heel and
with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. THE BOY WHO LIVED

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Privet swhich lay silent
and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would on, It

to put and toe milk bottles, nor that hot kould spend the next few

THE VANISHING GLASS
early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken
up to find their nephew on the frontets , but es ofDrive
had hardly changed at all. The sun oar ankesame lenty front gardens
and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys-1 fsame l door;
it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same
as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful
news report about the owlsing uly the photographs on the mantelpiece
really showed how much time had passed. T
eaars ago,
there had been lots of picturat hed what looked like a large pink
beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -1 but Dudley Dursley
was no longer a baby, and now the ping ulgraphs showed a large
blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing
a computer game with his father, being huggeprodkissed by his
ontoher. The room held no signrdly l that another boy lived in the
house, too.
